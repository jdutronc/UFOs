# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Our friend Dana has tasked us with building an html page to display and filter UFO data that she has in her possession in javascript format. We have put together a few basic text and design elements on the page, and built a dynamic table to display the UFO data and filter by date. Now Dana wants to be able to also filter the data by city, state, country and UFO shape.

## Results

### Welcome Screen

We have created a neat welcome screen with a large jumbotron image across, a title and a welcome text by Dana.
